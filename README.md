# Airbnb market analysis and real estate sales
# 1. Introduction
## Project Overview
The Airbnb Analysis project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data from the travel industry and property management domain. By leveraging various data analysis and visualization tools, we aim to extract valuable insights into pricing dynamics, availability patterns, and location-based trends in Airbnb listings.
# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:

1) Ensure data quality and consistency by addressing missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
2) Standardize data formats and rectify inconsistencies in column names or values.
3) Validate and clean geographic coordinates, zip codes, and other location-based data to maintain data integrity.
4) Utilize EDA techniques to grasp data distributions, trends, and interrelationships.
5) Summarize and visualize key features using descriptive statistics, histograms, scatter plot and heat map
6) Identify correlations between variables and uncover potential patterns or anomalies.
7) Analyzing geographic trends analysis to identify spatial clusters, hotspots, or patterns in Airbnb listings or amenities distribution.
8) Visualization process utilizes various tools and libraries, such as matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, to generate static and interactive visualizations like plots and charts.

# About Dataset

This dataset, titled 'Airbnb Market Analysis and Real Estate Sales Data (2019),' comprises a comprehensive collection of information pertaining to the Airbnb rental market and property sales in two distinct areas within California: Big Bear and Joshua Tree, along with their associated zip codes (92314, 92315, 92284, and 92252). The dataset provides monthly aggregated data, allowing for an in-depth analysis of rental and real estate market trends in these regions. It includes the following files:

## Datasets:
### Market Analysis:
This file contains listing-level information from 2019, aggregated on a monthly basis. It encompasses various metrics, such as unique property codes (unified_id), generated revenue, availability (openness), occupancy ratios, nightly rates, lead times, and average length of stay for reservations made each month. Additionally, it provides insights into property amenities.

### Amenities:
This file indicates whether a listing has specific amenities, denoting their presence with a value of 1 or their absence with a value of 0. Notably, it identifies the availability of a pool or hot tub in each listing.

### Geolocation:
This file contains latitude and longitude coordinates for each listing, enabling precise spatial analysis and visualization.

### Sales Properties:
This dataset provides information concerning properties available for sale within the study areas. In the Joshua Tree region (zip codes 92284 and 92252), there are two separate filesâ€”one presenting the overall information about sales properties and the other focusing on properties with pools.

This dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and analysts interested in gaining insights into the real estate and Airbnb rental markets in California, particularly within the specified regions.

The visualization above illustrates the distribution of hot tubs and pools among the properties in the dataset.

In the first subplot, "Distribution of Hot Tubs," the bar plot shows the count of properties with and without hot tubs. The blue bars represent the presence or absence of hot tubs, with "Absent" indicating properties without hot tubs and "Present" indicating properties with hot tubs. From this plot, it's evident that there are more properties without hot tubs compared to those with hot tubs.

In the second subplot, "Distribution of Pools," the bar plot displays the count of properties with and without pools. Similarly, the green bars represent the presence or absence of pools, with "Absent" indicating properties without pools and "Present" indicating properties with pools. Here, it's noticeable that the majority of properties do not have pools, as indicated by the higher count of "Absent" compared to "Present."

The heatmap visualization above represents the correlation between the presence of hot tubs and pools in properties.
##### In this heatmap:
The cell at the intersection of 'hot_tub' and 'pool' displays the correlation coefficient, which quantifies the relationship between the presence of hot tubs and pools.
Annotating the heatmap with correlation values provides a quick overview of the strength and direction of the correlation.
The colormap ('coolwarm') visually represents the correlation values, with cool colors (blue) indicating negative correlations, warm colors (red) indicating positive correlations, and shades of white representing values close to zero.
##### Interpretation:
A positive correlation coefficient closer to 1 suggests that the presence of hot tubs and pools tends to co-occur, meaning properties with hot tubs are more likely to have pools as well.
A negative correlation coefficient closer to -1 would indicate the opposite scenario, where the presence of one feature is associated with the absence of the other.
A correlation coefficient close to 0 implies no significant linear relationship between the presence of hot tubs and pools.
